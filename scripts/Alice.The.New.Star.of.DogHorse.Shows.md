Alice is a three-year-old border collie who loves to run, jump and play. She was adopted by her owner, Lisa, from a shelter when she was a puppy. Lisa is a professional horse trainer who decided to teach Alice some basic commands and introduce her to Max, a six-year-old quarter horse.
 
"I was amazed by how quickly Alice learned and how well she got along with Max. They have a special bond and they trust each other completely. They are always happy to see each other and they enjoy working together," Lisa said.
 
Lisa started to train Alice and Max for dog-horse shows, which are competitions that test the skills and teamwork of both animals. The shows consist of various events, such as obstacle courses, freestyle routines and relay races. Alice and Max have to follow Lisa's cues and perform different tasks, such as weaving through poles, jumping over hurdles, fetching objects and balancing on platforms.
 
"It's not easy to train a dog and a horse to do these things. It takes a lot of patience, practice and positive reinforcement. But Alice and Max are very smart and eager to please. They love the challenge and they have fun doing it," Lisa said.
 
Alice and Max have participated in several dog-horse shows across the country and have won many awards and fans. They have also appeared on TV shows and magazines, where they have impressed audiences with their remarkable skills and adorable personalities.
 
"Alice and Max are amazing. They are so cute and talented. They make me smile every time I see them," said one of their fans.
 
Lisa said she is proud of Alice and Max and hopes to inspire more people to adopt dogs from shelters and appreciate the bond between dogs and horses.
 
"Alice and Max are more than just pets. They are my family and my best friends. They have changed my life for the better and I'm so grateful for them. They are truly the stars of my show," Lisa said.
  
One of the most popular events that Alice and Max perform in is the freestyle routine, where they showcase their creativity and personality. They can choose their own music, costumes and props and perform any tricks they want. Lisa said she lets Alice and Max decide what they want to do and just follows their lead.
 
"Alice and Max have their own style and flair. They like to mix things up and surprise me and the audience. Sometimes they do things I didn't teach them or expect them to do. They are very spontaneous and expressive," Lisa said.
 
Some of the tricks that Alice and Max have done in their freestyle routines include dancing, spinning, bowing, playing dead, rolling over, kissing, hugging and high-fiving. They have also used props such as hats, sunglasses, scarves, balls and hoops. They have performed to different genres of music, such as rock, pop, country and classical.
 
"Alice and Max are very musical and they have a good sense of rhythm. They can match their movements to the beat and the mood of the song. They also have a good sense of humor and they like to make people laugh with their antics," Lisa said.
 
Lisa said she hopes that Alice and Max's freestyle routines will inspire more people to try dog-horse shows and discover the joy of working with animals.
 
"Dog-horse shows are a great way to bond with your dog and your horse and have fun with them. They also help you improve your communication, coordination and confidence. You don't need any special equipment or experience to do it. You just need love, trust and respect," Lisa said.
